Always try best to follow the best practices:

- Prefer short and side-effect free functions over long and side-effectful functions.
- Prefer immutable data structures over mutable ones.
- Prefer the simplest possible solution over the most complex one. Never over-engineer.
- Use descriptive yet short names for variables, functions, classes, and modules. Exception: use single letter names for loop variables and parameters of one-liner functions.
- Add documentation to all public functions and classes.
- Write unit tests for all public functions and classes. Tests should be colocated with the code they test.
- Look for opportunities to refactor code to reveal the underlying intent and remove duplication.
- Never use `any` type.
- When you import typescript file in this project, do not omit the extension `.ts`.
