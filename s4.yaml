  S4: A Framework for AI-Driven Software Development
mission: >-
  Enable stateless AI-human collaboration in software development through semi-structured specifications that provide complete project context on demand.
vision: >-
  A world where every development session is self-contained and context-complete, eliminating the need for chat history or context preservation while maintaining full traceability from business goals to working code.
businessObjectives:
  - id: BO-0001
    description: >-
      Eliminate context decay in AI-assisted development by providing complete project context through [[Semi-Structured Software Specification]]s that enable stateless [[AI-Driven Development]] collaboration.
  - id: BO-0002
    description: >-
      Ensure consistent understanding between humans and AI agents through [[Specification as Single Source of Truth]] that eliminates ambiguity and maintains alignment across development sessions.
  - id: BO-0003
    description: >-
      Maintain complete [[Traceability]] from business goals to implementation, ensuring every line of code serves a documented business purpose and can be validated against acceptance criteria.
# MARK: Concepts
concepts:
  - id: Semi-Structured Software Specification
    description: >-
      A YAML-based document format that serves as the single source of truth for software projects, containing [[Business Objective]]s, [[Feature]]s, [[Acceptance Test]]s, and supporting metadata. Designed for both human readability and AI agent consumption, it enables stateless development by providing complete project context without requiring conversation history or external documentation.
  - id: Business Objective
    description: >-
      A high-level strategic goal that defines the business value and purpose behind software development efforts, identified by a "BO-####" ID format. These objectives provide the foundational "why" that drives feature prioritization and implementation decisions, ensuring all development work serves documented business purposes.
  - id: Feature
    description: >-
      A concrete, implementable functionality that delivers specific business value, identified by a "FE-####" ID format. Features represent the "what" to be built and must be directly traceable to one or more [[Business Objective]]s, providing clear implementation scope and acceptance criteria for AI agents and development teams.
  - id: Acceptance Test
    description: >-
      A specific, executable test case that defines the exact conditions a [[Feature]] must satisfy to be considered complete, identified by an "AT-####" ID format and written in Given-When-Then style. These tests serve as the definitive acceptance criteria, enabling automated validation and providing clear implementation guidance for AI agents and developers.
  - id: Traceability
    description: >-
      The systematic ability to track and verify complete coverage relationships between [[Business Objective]]s, [[Feature]]s, [[Acceptance Test]]s, and implementation code. This ensures that every business objective is covered by features, every feature is covered by acceptance tests, every acceptance test is implemented and executable, and all dependencies are properly documented and validated throughout the development lifecycle.
  - id: Human-in-the-Loop
    description: >-
      A collaborative development methodology where AI agents autonomously execute implementation tasks while human stakeholders maintain strategic control through validation, oversight, and decision-making at critical junctures, ensuring business alignment and quality standards are maintained.
  - id: AI-Driven Development
    description: >-
      A development methodology where an AI agent's actions are directed by the `s4` CLI. It follows the [[Neuro-Symbolic Development]] model and uses [[Inversion of Control]] to assign tasks. The AI agent executes the specific implementation steps provided by the CLI, while a human provides strategic oversight as part of a [[Human-in-the-Loop]] process.
  - id: Inversion of Control
    description: >-
      A design pattern where the `s4` CLI (the framework) controls the development workflow, not the AI agent (the tool). The agent calls `s4 status` to be assigned its next task. This delegates process control to the symbolic engine, which follows a deterministic order of operations (validation, synchronization, testing).
  - id: Neuro-Symbolic Development
    description: >-
      A hybrid development model that separates responsibilities between a symbolic engine (the `s4` CLI) and a neural engine (an AI agent). The symbolic engine manages structured validation, traceability, and process control. The neural engine is responsible for tasks involving natural language understanding and code generation, operating within the boundaries set by the symbolic engine.
  - id: Specification as Single Source of Truth
    description: >-
      The principle that the [[Semi-Structured Software Specification]] serves as the definitive, authoritative source for all project requirements, design decisions, and development guidance. Code is treated as a derived artifact that must conform to and implement the specification. When discrepancies arise between the specification and implementation, the specification takes precedence and the code must be modified to align with it, ensuring consistency and preventing drift.
# MARK: Features
features:
  - id: FE-0001
    title: Read spec from file
    description: >-
      The CLI accepts a `--spec` option that specifies the path to the spec file, defaulting to `s4.yaml` in the current directory. This lets users work with spec files directly instead of stdin.
    covers: [BO-0001, BO-0002]
  - id: FE-0002
    title: Check internal consistency of the spec
    description: >-
      The CLI performs internal consistency validation by checking that specifications provided via the `--spec` option follow required structural rules, including proper ID formats, complete [[Traceability]] across [[Business Objective]]s, [[Feature]]s, and [[Acceptance Test]]s, and the absence of circular dependencies. Error messages guide the reader (AI or human) to modify the spec to resolve inconsistencies.
    covers: [BO-0002, BO-0003]
    prerequisites: [FE-0001]
  - id: FE-0003
    title: Show overall status of the project with comprehensive context and recommended next actions
    description: >-
      The CLI analyzes the current state of the project and provides actionable guidance on the next actions. It first shows a summarized context containing the project title, mission, vision, business objectives, and a list of features with completion stats based on passing acceptance tests. After this summary, it recommends specific next steps, helping AI agents and humans prioritize their work by addressing validation, synchronization, tests, and code quality issues in order of priority.

      Test-to-production code ratio is too high. Simplify tests while keeping test coverage about the same.

      Here are some tips:

      - Simplify assertions by define DSLs using `expect.extend({})`
      - Comments and empty lines are not counted in the code calculation, so there's no need to remove them.
      - Run this command to check the longest test files: `tokei --type TypeScript -f -s code | grep "test.ts" | head -n 10`
